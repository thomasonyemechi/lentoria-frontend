                            including a

                            someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with
                            your
                            password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account.

                            between students or instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify

                            immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your

                            (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our Support Team. We may
                            request
                            some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.</p>

                            on
                            Lentoria and use the Services. If you are younger than 16 but above the required age for
                            consent
                            to use online services where you live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), you may
                            not
                            set up an account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account
                            and
                            help you access content that is appropriate for you. If you are below this age of consent to
                            use
                            online services, you may not create a Lentoria account. If we discover that you have created
                            an
                            account that violates these rules, we will terminate your account. Under our Instructor

                            you may be requested to verify your identity before you are authorized to submit content for
                            publication on Lentoria.
                            You can terminate your account at any time by following the steps here. Check our Privacy

                            generally grant you a lifetime access license, except when we must disable the content

                            grant Lentoria a license to offer a license to the content to students. This means that we
                            have
                            the right to sublicense the content to enrolled students. As a student, when you enroll in a

                            Lentoria to view the content via the Lentoria platform and Services, and Lentoria is the
                            licensor of record. Content is licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give
                            you
                            any right to resell the content in any manner (including by sharing account information with

                            paid

                            content
                            unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a Lentoria
                            authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access via any of our
                            APIs.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in
                            a
                            course or other content. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and

                            any content at any point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable
                            access
                            to the content due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course or other content
                            you
                            enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine it violates our Trust
                            &
                            Safety Guidelines. This lifetime access license does not apply to enrollments via
                            Subscription
                            Plans or to add-on features and services associated with the course or other content you
                            enroll
                            in. For example, instructors may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance
                            or
                            Q&A services in association with the content. To be clear, the lifetime access is to the
                            course
                            content but not to the instructor.
                            Instructors may not grant licenses to their content to students directly, and any such
                            direct
                            license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4">The prices of content on Lentoria are determined based on the terms of
                            the Instructor Terms . In some instances, the price of content offered on the Lentoria
                            website
                            may not be exactly the same as the price offered on our mobile or TV applications, due to
                            mobile
                            platform providers’ pricing systems and their policies around implementing sales and
                            promotions.
                            If you are logged into your account, the listed currency you see is based on your location
                            when
                            you created your account. If you are not logged into your account, the price currency is
                            based
                            on the country where you are located. We do not enable users to see pricing in other
                            currencies.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.2 Payments</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize us to

                            you

                            someone is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know.
                            You may not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful purposes. Your use

                            content, the instructor may invite you to submit content as “homework” or tests. Don’t post
                            or
                            submit anything that is not yours.</p>

                            content. In both cases, you must abide by the law and respect the rights of others: you
                            cannot
                            post any course, question, answer, review or other content that violates applicable local or

                            content, and actions you post or take via the platform and Services and their consequences.
                            Make

                            and students to interact for teaching and learning. Like other platforms where people can

                            content and interact, some things can go wrong, and you use Lentoria at your own risk.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">Our platform model means we do not review or edit the content for legal issues,
                            and we are not in a position to determine the legality of content. We do not exercise any
                            editorial control over the content that is available on the platform and, as such, do not
                            guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy, or truthfulness of the content.
                            If
                            you access content, you rely on any information provided by an instructor at your own

                            about the types of personal information that you share. While we restrict the types of
                            information instructors may request from students, we do not control what students and
                            instructors do with the information they obtain from other users on the platform. You should
                            not

                            This section covers additional terms that apply to your use of our subscription-based
                            collections as a student (“Subscription Plans”). By using a Subscription Plan, you agree to
                            the
                            additional terms in this section. Note that use of Lentoria Business is not subject to these
                            Terms, but is instead governed by the agreement between Lentoria and the subscribing
                            organization.</p>
                        <h3>8.1 Subscription Plans</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">During your subscription to a Subscription Plan, you get a limited,
                            non-exclusive, non-transferable license from us to access and view the content included in
                            that
                            Subscription Plan via the Services. With the exception of the lifetime access license grant,
                            the
                            terms included in the “Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access” section above apply to
                            enrollments via Subscription Plans.
                            The subscription that you purchase or renew determines the scope, features, and price of
                            your
                            access to a Subscription Plan. You may not transfer, assign, or share your subscription with
                            anyone else.
                            We reserve the right to revoke any license to use the content in our Subscription Plans for
                            legal or policy reasons at any time and at our sole discretion, such as if we no longer have
                            the
                            right to offer the content through a Subscription Plan. Additional information on our right
                            to
                            revoke is included in the “Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access” section.</p>
                        <h3>8.2 Account Management</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">You may cancel your subscription by following the steps outlined on our Support
                            Page. If you cancel your subscription to a Subscription Plan, your access to that
                            Subscription
                            Plan will automatically end on the last day of your billing period. On cancellation, you
                            will
                            not be entitled to receive a refund or credit of any fees already paid for your
                            subscription,
                            unless otherwise required by applicable law. For clarity, cancellation of a subscription
                            does
                            not terminate your Lentoria account.</p>

                            These Terms are like any other contract, and they have boring but important legal terms that
                            protect us from the countless things that could happen and that clarify the legal
                            relationship
                            between us and you.</p>
                        <h3>9.1 Binding Agreement</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">
                            You agree that by registering, accessing, or using our Services, you are agreeing to enter
                            into
                            a legally binding contract with Lentoria. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not
                            register,
                            access, or otherwise use any of our Services.
                            If you are an instructor accepting these Terms and using our Services on behalf of a
                            company,
                            organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are
                            authorized to do so.
                            Any version of these Terms in a language other than English is provided for convenience and
                            you
                            understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict.
                            These Terms (including any agreements and policies linked from these Terms) constitute the
                            entire agreement between you and us (which include, if you are an instructor, the Instructor
                            Terms and the Promotions Policy).</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">
                            If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then
                            that
                            provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
                            matches
                            the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in
                            effect.
                            Even if we are delayed in exercising our rights or fail to exercise a right in one case, it
                            doesn’t mean we waive our rights under these Terms, and we may decide to enforce them in the
                            future. If we decide to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn’t mean we
                            waive our rights generally or in the future.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">The following sections shall survive the expiration or termination of these

                        <p class="fs-4">It may happen that our platform is down, either for planned maintenance or
                            because something goes down with the site. It may happen that one of our instructors is
                            making
                            misleading statements in their content. It may also happen that we encounter security
                            issues.
                            These are just examples. You accept that you will not have any recourse against us in any of
                            these types of cases where things don’t work out right. In legal, more complete
                            language, the
                            Services and their content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We (and our
                            affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no representations or warranties about the
                            suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, security, lack of errors, or accuracy of
                            the
                            Services or their content, and expressly disclaim any warranties or conditions (express or
                            implied), including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                            title, and non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make
                            no
                            warranty that you will obtain specific results from use of the Services. Your use of the
                            Services (including any content) is entirely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions don’t
                            allow
                            the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to
                            you.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at any
                            time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will Lentoria or its affiliates, suppliers,
                            partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of
                            availability of such features.
                            We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the Services caused
                            by
                            events beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural
                            disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage; or government restrictions.</p>
                        <h3>9.3 Limitation of Liability</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">
                            There are risks inherent to using our Services, for example, if you access health and
                            wellness
                            content like yoga, and you injure yourself. You fully accept these risks and you agree that
                            you
                            will have no recourse to seek damages against even if you suffer loss or damage from using
                            our
                            platform and Services. In legal, more complete language, to the extent permitted by law, we
                            (and
                            our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) will not be liable for any indirect,
                            incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or
                            business opportunities, or personal injury or death), whether arising in contract, warranty,
                            tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if we’ve been advised of the possibility of
                            damages in advance. Our liability (and the liability of each of our group companies,
                            suppliers,
                            partners, and agents) to you or any third parties under any circumstance is limited to the
                            greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or the amount you have paid us in the twelve (12)
                            months
                            before the event giving rise to your claims. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion or
                            limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some of the above may
                            not
                            apply to you.</p>
                        <h3>9.4 Indemnification</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">
                            If you behave in a way that gets us in legal trouble, we may exercise legal recourse against
                            you. You agree to indemnify, defend (if we so request), and hold harmless Lentoria, our
                            group
                            companies, and their officers, directors, suppliers, partners, and agents from an against

                        <p class="fs-4">
                            If we can’t resolve our dispute amicably, you and Lentoria agree to resolve any claims
                            related
                            to these Terms (or our other legal terms) through final and binding arbitration, regardless
                            of
                            the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be
                            arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to
                            force
                            us both to go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt
                            a
                            court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p>

                            < We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action,
                                consolidated action, or representative action;
                            </li>
                            <li>an arbitrator can’t combine multiple people’s claims into a single case (or preside over
                                any consolidated, class, or representative action); and
                            </li>
                            <li>an arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact that user, not
                                other users, and can’t be used to decide other users’ disputes. If a court decides that
                                this “No class actions” clause isn’t enforceable or valid, then this “Dispute
                                Resolution” section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.

                            NG. company. We reserve the right not to pay out funds in the event of identified fraud,
                            violations of intellectual property rights, or other violations of the law.
                            If we cannot settle funds into your payment account after the period of time set forth by
                            your
                            state, country, or other government authority in its unclaimed property laws, we may process
                            the
                            funds due to you in accordance with our legal obligations, including by submitting those
                            funds
                            to the appropriate government authority as required by law.</p>
                        <h3>5.4 Refunds</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">You acknowledge and agree that students have the right to receive a refund, as
                            detailed in the Terms of Use. Instructors will not receive any revenue from transactions for
                            which a refund has been granted under the Terms of Use.
                            If a student asks for a refund after we have paid the relevant instructor payment, we
                            reserve
                            the right to either (1) deduct the amount of the refund from the next payment sent to the
                            instructor or (2) where no further payments are due to the instructor or the payments are
                            insufficient to cover the refunded amounts, require the instructor to refund any amounts
                            refunded to students for the instructor's Submitted Content.</p>

                            We use cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to collect, store, and
                            share
                            data about your activities across websites, including on Lentoria. They allow us to remember
                            things about your visits to Lentoria, like your preferred language, and to make the site
                            easier
                            to use. .
                            Lentoria and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third-party
                            advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags,
                            scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together, “Data
                            Collection Tools“) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools
                            automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section
                            1)
                            when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data Collection
                            Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.

                        <h3>2.2 Why We Use Data Collection Tools</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">
                            Lentoria uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the purposes described:
                            oStrictly Necessary: These Data Collection Tools enable you to access the site, provide
                            basic
                            functionality (like logging in or accessing content), secure the site, protect against
                            fraudulent logins, and detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account. These
                            are
                            required for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them, parts of the site will
                            break
                            or be unavailable.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4"><b>Functional:</b> These Data Collection Tools remember data about your browser
                            and your preferences, provide additional site functionality, customize content to be more
                            relevant to you, and remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior of the Services
                            (like your preferred language or volume level for video playback).</p>
                        <p class="fs-4"><b>Performance:</b> These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve the
                            Services by providing usage and performance data, visit counts, traffic sources, or where an
                            application was downloaded from. These tools can help us test different versions of Lentoria
                            to
                            see which features or content users prefer and determine which email messages are opened.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-4"><b>Advertising:</b> These Data Collection Tools are used to deliver relevant ads
                            (on the site and/or other sites) based on things we know about you like your Usage and
                            System
                            Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that the ad service providers know about you
                            based
                            on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time
                            and
                            across other sites and services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these
                            service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in a
                            non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4"><b>Social Media:</b> These Data Collection Tools enable social media
                            functionality, like sharing content with friends and networks. These cookies may track a
                            user or
                            device across other sites and build a profile of user interests for targeted advertising
                            purposes.</p>
