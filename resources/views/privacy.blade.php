                            We use tools like cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to gather the data
                            . Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">
                            We use cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to collect, store, and
                            share data about your activities across websites, including on Lentoria. They allow us to
                            remember things about your visits to Lentoria, like your preferred language, and to make the
                            site easier to use. .
                            Lentoria and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third-party
                            advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags,
                            scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together, “Data
                            Collection Tools“) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools
                            automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section
                            1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data
                            Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2.2 Why We Use Data Collection Tools</h3>
                        <p class="fs-4">
                            Lentoria uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the purposes described:
                            oStrictly Necessary: These Data Collection Tools enable you to access the site, provide
                            basic functionality (like logging in or accessing content), secure the site, protect against
                            fraudulent logins, and detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account. These
                            are required for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them, parts of the site
                            will break or be unavailable.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4"><b>Functional:</b> These Data Collection Tools remember data about your browser
                            and your preferences, provide additional site functionality, customize content to be more
                            relevant to you, and remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior of the Services
                            (like your preferred language or volume level for video playback).</p>
                        <p class="fs-4"><b>Performance:</b> These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve the
                            Services by providing usage and performance data, visit counts, traffic sources, or where an
                            application was downloaded from. These tools can help us test different versions of Lentoria
                            to see which features or content users prefer and determine which email messages are opened.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-4"><b>Advertising:</b> These Data Collection Tools are used to deliver relevant ads
                            (on the site and/or other sites) based on things we know about you like your Usage and
                            System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that the ad service providers know about
                            you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity
                            over time and across other sites and services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may
                            provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in
                            a non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4"><b>Social Media:</b> These Data Collection Tools enable social media
                            functionality, like sharing content with friends and networks. These cookies may track a
                            user or device across other sites and build a profile of user interests for targeted
                            advertising purposes.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4">You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on
                            your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you
                            do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may
                            be different or less functional. To learn more about managing Data Collection Tools, refer
                            to Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below.</p>

                            These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however,
                            no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and
